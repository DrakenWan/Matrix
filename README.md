# Matrix
 Linear Algebra library in C++

The matrix code as of now is just a copy of the matrix data structure I made in [AbstractDS repo](https://github.com/DrakenWan/Abstract-Data-Structures). I am going to now create a standalone linear algebra library in c++. This is just me experimenting for my scientific computing course.
